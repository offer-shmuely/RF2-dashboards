# Rotorflight Heli Flight Controller Dashboard

This dashboard configures itself directly from the flight controller, requiring minimal setup.  
The goal is to make it as plug-and-play as possible for most users.

Even without telemetry defined, the dashboard can retrieve most of the necessary data.  
However, enabling telemetry allows for faster updates.

### Data Read from Rotorflight:
- Cell count  
- Battery capacity  
- Minimum voltage  
- Maximum voltage  
- Battery percentage  
- Head speed  
- Armed / Not-armed state  
- Blackbox size and usage  
- Profile ID (bank)  
- Rate ID
